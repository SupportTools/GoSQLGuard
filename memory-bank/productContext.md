# Product Context for GoSQLGuard

## Why This Project Exists

Database backups are critical to any production system, yet many organizations struggle with:

1. **Inconsistent backup processes** - Manual or ad-hoc backup processes lead to missed backups
2. **Poor visibility** - Lack of clear reporting on backup status and history
3. **Storage management** - Insufficient retention policies causing excessive storage use or premature backup deletion
4. **Recovery confidence** - Uncertainty about whether backups can be restored when needed
5. **Multi-environment complexity** - Different backup approaches across development, staging, and production

GoSQLGuard addresses these challenges by providing a uniform, reliable, and observable backup solution specifically designed for MySQL databases.

## Problems It Solves

### For Database Administrators
- **Automation Gap**: Eliminates the need for custom backup scripts that require ongoing maintenance
- **Monitoring Blindspot**: Provides clear visibility into backup status, size, and success rates
- **Storage Sprawl**: Manages backup retention automatically to prevent storage overuse
- **Cross-compatibility**: Works with various MySQL versions and S3-compatible storage solutions

### For DevOps Teams
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Configuration-driven approach fits modern infrastructure practices
- **Observability Challenge**: Exposes Prometheus metrics to integrate with monitoring systems
- **Compliance Requirements**: Helps meet data protection and retention requirements
- **Operational Overhead**: Reduces time spent managing and monitoring backup processes

### For System Administrators
- **Reliability Concerns**: Improves backup consistency with scheduled, automated execution
- **Recovery Readiness**: Maintains comprehensive metadata to facilitate quick restoration
- **Resource Utilization**: Optimizes storage through compression and retention policies
- **Multi-environment Management**: Provides a consistent approach across different environments

## How It Should Work

### User Experience Goals

1. **Configuration Simplicity**: Setup should be straightforward with sensible defaults
   - YAML-based configuration for all aspects of the system
   - Environment variable support for container-friendly deployment

2. **Zero-touch Operation**: Once configured, backups should run automatically
   - Scheduled execution based on cron expressions
   - Automatic enforcement of retention policies
   - Self-recovery from temporary failures

3. **Clear Status Visibility**: Current state should be immediately obvious
   - Web-based dashboard showing backup status at a glance
   - Detailed history of backup operations
   - Filtering options to focus on specific databases or backup types

4. **Actionable Alerting**: Failures should be promptly communicated
   - Integration with monitoring systems via Prometheus metrics
   - Detailed error reporting to facilitate troubleshooting

5. **Straightforward Recovery**: Backup restoration should be intuitive
   - Clear metadata about available backups
   - Simple API for backup retrieval

### Workflow Patterns

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - Configure database connections
   - Define backup schedules (hourly, daily, weekly)
   - Set up storage locations (local, S3)
   - Configure retention policies

2. **Regular Operation**:
   - System automatically executes backups according to schedule
   - Backups are stored in defined locations
   - Metadata is updated with backup details
   - Expired backups are removed according to retention policies

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Admin interface shows backup status and history
   - Prometheus metrics provide integration with monitoring systems
   - Failure alerts are generated when backups fail

4. **Maintenance**:
   - Configuration updates as needed
   - Review of storage utilization
   - Periodic verification of backup integrity

5. **Restore Scenario**:
   - Locate the appropriate backup via metadata
   - Retrieve backup from storage location
   - Execute restore operation (handled separately from GoSQLGuard)

### Integration Philosophy

GoSQLGuard is designed to be a focused component in a larger system ecosystem:

1. **Complementary**: Works alongside database management tools rather than replacing them
2. **Observable**: Exposes metrics and status information to external monitoring systems
3. **Automatable**: Provides APIs for integration with orchestration tools
4. **Adaptable**: Configurable to work in various environments from development to production
