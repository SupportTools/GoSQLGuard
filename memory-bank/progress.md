## What's Left to Build

### Short-term Goals
1. ✅ ST-00: Enhanced error logging and display in UI (COMPLETED)
2. ✅ ST-06: Multi-Server UI Enhancements (COMPLETED)
3. ⚠️ ST-05: MySQL dump options UI configuration (PARTIALLY COMPLETED - UI done, needs config persistence)
4. ✅ ST-03: Enhanced UI Filtering (COMPLETED)
5. ✅ ST-01: Metadata Persistence Testing (COMPLETED)
6. ✅ ST-02: Implement metadata recovery from existing backups (COMPLETED)
7. ✅ ST-04: Performance optimization for metadata operations (COMPLETED)
8. ✅ ST-07: Multi-Server Documentation (COMPLETED)

### Medium-term Goals
1. ⏳ MT-01: Backup verification features
2. ⏳ MT-02: Enhanced reporting features
3. ⏳ MT-03: Extended API endpoints for programmatic access
4. ⏳ MT-04: Better error recovery mechanisms
5. ⏳ MT-05: PostgreSQL database support

### Long-term Goals
1. 📅 LT-01: Backup encryption support
2. 📅 LT-02: Authentication system for admin UI
3. 📅 LT-03: Backup archival to cold storage
4. 📅 LT-04: Multi-server coordination for distributed setups
5. 📅 LT-05: Comprehensive API documentation
6. 📅 LT-06: React frontend integration with subscription model

## Current Status

### System Status
- **Core System**: Functioning with basic features
- **Metadata System**: Recently integrated, requires further testing
- **Admin UI**: Working with recent fixes for rendering issues
- **Storage Providers**: Working for both local and S3
- **Scheduler**: Functioning with cron-based scheduling
- **Frontend Modernization**: Planning phase for React/Next.js integration

### Development Focus
We are currently focused on:
1. Planning the integration of a modern React frontend with the existing Go backend
2. Adding customization options for MySQL dump commands to optimize backups
3. Solidifying the metadata system integration
4. Ensuring proper UI rendering

The main themes are improving reliability, performance, and flexibility while planning for a modernized user interface.

### Recent Milestones
- Created detailed plan for React frontend integration with Next.js, Auth0, and MariaDB
- Implemented configurable MySQL dump options system
- Added support for backup-type optimized MySQL dump settings
- Integrated metadata system with all components
- Fixed template rendering issues in the admin UI
- Enhanced retention policy enforcement to update metadata
- Improved type safety in templates

## Known Issues

### Technical Debt
1. 🐛 UI edge cases with null values in metadata
2. 🐛 Potential memory growth for very long-running instances
3. 🐛 Limited automated testing for UI components
4. 🐛 Template error reporting could be more detailed

### Features Missing from MVP
1. ❌ Built-in backup verification (MT-01)
2. ❌ Authentication system for admin UI (LT-02)
3. ❌ Advanced filtering options in UI (ST-03)
4. ❌ Comprehensive API documentation (LT-05)
5. ❌ PostgreSQL database support (MT-05)
6. ❌ Modern React frontend with Auth0 authentication (LT-06)

### Performance Concerns
1. ⚠️ Metadata operations may slow down with very large backup sets
2. ⚠️ S3 transfer performance for very large backups
3. ⚠️ Concurrent operations handling needs stress testing

## Next Actions

### Immediate Tasks
1. **ST-08: MySQL Authentication Error Handling**
2. **TD-01: Improve UI edge case handling**
3. **Complete ST-05: Implement configuration persistence for MySQL options**
4. **Start MT-01: Backup verification features**

### Upcoming Work
1. Start work on PostgreSQL support (MT-05)
   - Create database engine abstraction (MT-05.1)
   - Update configuration system (MT-05.2)
2. Enhance UI filtering capabilities (ST-03)
3. Start performance profiling and optimization (ST-04)
4. Improve template error reporting (TD-04)
5. Develop React frontend proof of concept
   - Set up Next.js project with TypeScript (POC-01)
   - Convert key HTML endpoints to JSON API (POC-02)
   - Implement Auth0 authentication (POC-03)
